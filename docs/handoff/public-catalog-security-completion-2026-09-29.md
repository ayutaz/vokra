# Public catalog and security completion plan (2026-09-29)

**Status: active.** This is the execution queue for the owner's request to
finish the public Mac CPU/Apple Metal catalog, repair public artifacts, and
resolve the dependency and OpenSSF findings. It is not a completion claim or
an upload authorization.

## Audited starting point

- Clean GitHub `main`: `79745a4d7c8330f8b760e405cf7b9276c4a7fb49`;
  no open PR at this snapshot.
- Read-only `uv run --no-project --python 3.12 python tools/audit/hf_mac_coverage.py --format summary`:
  194 public repositories,
  193 with GGUF, 198 GGUF files. CPU code/artifact reachability is 136 `full`,
  43 `partial`, 14 `no-runtime-binder`, and 1 `not-artifact`; Metal is 136
  `full`, 57 `blocked-by-cpu`, and 1 `not-artifact`. Thus 58 rows are unresolved
  in the live public inventory. `full` is not a blanket real-weight Apple
  hardware parity verdict.
- GitHub Dependabot open-alert API: 258 open, 226 with a named patched version
  and 32 without one. Open code-scanning findings: `CIIBestPracticesID`,
  `CodeReviewID`, `MaintainedID`, `SASTID`, and `VulnerabilitiesID` (one each).
- The 2026-09-21 M5 owner checklist has 53 checked and 29 unchecked literal
  boxes. Its prose-only GA and platform conditions remain additional work.
- VAST account readback: one running instance labelled
  `ralomi-m4r-bounded-context-v2-v21`, unrelated to Vokra; no retained
  volumes. Do not operate on that instance. Old Vokra instance IDs in dated
  records are not available transfer sources.

The live audit logic and HF revisions, GitHub alert API, exact source/weight
manifests, and measured parity packets supersede this dated count whenever
they change. Do not replace historical measurements with a current total.

### 2026-09-29 continuation readback (01:56 UTC)

The read-only HF summary still reports 194 public repositories, 193 with
GGUFs, 198 GGUF files, CPU `136 full / 43 partial / 14 no-runtime-binder /
1 not-artifact`, and Metal `136 full / 57 blocked-by-cpu / 1 not-artifact`.
This does not prove real-weight or Apple parity. PR #146 merged at
`d8759c6dc870a9ba5c4ef48ed342c13eb9cb1800`; PR #135 was rebased onto
that main head and awaits its fresh CI. PRs #137 and #142 remain stacked on
#135 and #137 respectively, and PR #147 remains draft. No model row is
promoted by these model-free changes.

The unmerged XY-Tokenizer closure candidate at clean head
`e7806fe3f37d497362956b89841f4db26172c043` has lock SHA-256
`c445c7c2f6dfc036620ff7cf123b974f0e519f2081c62ca9bde2a73c61c1ae57`.
Its exact-head VAST model-free collector reports 38 active dependency rows,
35 successful and three blocked: SciPy 1.18.1, setuptools 84.0.0 and
tokenizers 0.23.1. The recovered collection report SHA-256 is
`d78e22695d668a4c2e57317f8dfb975544041136c0973f54f7bbf9328aa82b7c`;
the license-evidence SHA-256 is
`15166ba9dc0ad739defbdc6fa5787bf5ea6c4b65c331749b84933e0e88de0ec8`.
The subsequent exact-artifact probe found GPL-with-GCC-exception and LGPL
native terms in SciPy's wheel license payload, LGPL vendored terms in
setuptools, and no unambiguous distribution-owned primary license bytes in
tokenizers. A permissive classifier was therefore not added. This candidate
remains `BLOCKED` / `NO_UPLOAD`, with no checkpoint acquisition, model
execution, sign-off or Apple verdict. Both disposable XY VAST workers were
destroyed after the model-free checks; unrelated instances were untouched.

### 2026-09-29 CLAP and catalog continuation (09:18 UTC)

The live, read-only HF audit again found 194 public repositories, 193 with
GGUFs and 198 GGUF files: CPU `136 full / 43 partial / 14 no-runtime-binder /
1 not-artifact`; Metal `136 full / 57 blocked-by-cpu / 1 not-artifact`.
These are code/artifact reachability classes, not Apple real-weight parity.
The live GitHub Dependabot API now reports 342 open alerts, 299 with a patched
version and 43 without one; all five OpenSSF code-scanning findings remain
open. These current values supersede the dated starting-point counts above.
PR #137 merged at `30ae49231afe9c596d72404d0d72a8a5b91c611c`.

The CLAP reference-only Torch refresh at clean head
`0ba98c615337b9e1ccc2b4203b36e2fbf9f7f5d9` pins CPU Torch 2.13.0 and
passed the exact-head disposable VAST model-free worker, full workspace test,
`cargo fmt --all -- --check`, and workspace Clippy with `-D warnings`.
The regenerated model-free audit, dependency inventory and summary have
SHA-256 values `3671fccdda418ef85bccc21d11888527ac9fb6394d725715e8327524474435d0`,
`9f28e0261ff1958481ff44c3b9e66367dbc0fe1182616bb6cb0110be7f258019`
and `8610ce0d5f6cf3caf82cd9206f7850cefb4c067b4590fbe570d4beda06861670`.
The recovered evidence archive at
`/private/tmp/vokra-clap-mf-evidence-0ba98c61.tar.gz` matched remote SHA-256
`d60d86e51bcb851deaa7ebeebecffc4d838f56ed69b718210e8f43f1ee9dd39a`.
Its dependency inventory has 34 locked/installed distributions, zero factual
collection findings and 28 owner-review flags. Weights were not acquired;
model load and forward were not performed. The later candidate-binding commit
`7e05cffb` records this evidence but was not itself VAST-replayed. CLAP remains
`PENDING_OWNER_REVIEW` / runtime `BLOCKED` / `NO_UPLOAD`, with no real-weight,
Apple or publication claim. The dedicated VAST instance `53333436` was
destroyed after evidence recovery; individual API readback returned
`instances: null`, independent volumes `[]`. Unrelated account instances were
not modified.

## Completion rule for each model

Move a row only when the evidence for that stage exists: exact upstream
source/checkpoint/tokenizer/codec and license facts; reviewed owner decision
where required; strict converter, binder, native forward and CLI route;
independent fixed-upstream reference; no-upload real-weight VAST CPU parity;
fresh hash-bound transfer packet; Apple CPU/reference, Metal/reference and
Metal/CPU measurements with explicit no-fallback; separately authorized
publication or withholding; and a final live public audit. A build, synthetic
fixture, inspection route, or model-free self-test does not skip a stage.

The protected
`tools/parity/cosyvoice2_llm_reference/license_gate_manifest.json` must not be
read, edited, staged, reverted, or cleaned. The maintainer Mac performs no
model download or execution and no workspace or `vokra-models` Cargo work.
Disposable VAST workers handle large artifacts and workspace tests, with
small evidence recovered before destroy. Scaleway is the final Apple-hardware
stage after the non-Apple gates are closed or explicitly withheld.

## Complete 58-row work queue

The following groups are disjoint and are derived from the live TSV audit at
the starting head. The next action is a gate, not a claim that later stages
are already satisfied. Re-run the TSV audit and inspect per-row evidence before
moving any entry.

### Fourteen rows without a complete runtime binder

For each entry, authenticate source, artifact and license; implement the
strict binder, native forward and CLI route; then produce an independent
reference and real-weight CPU parity before Apple execution:

| Public repository | Immediate boundary |
|---|---|
| `vokra/ace-step-1.5` | Complete native binder/composite route. |
| `vokra/baichuan-audio` | Complete native binder/composite route. |
| `vokra/granite-speech-4.1-2b` | Complete native binder/composite route. |
| `vokra/hibiki-2b` | Complete native binder/composite route. |
| `vokra/htdemucs-multi` | Authenticate member ordering, per-member configuration and ensemble weights; resolve checkpoint/data/dependency terms. |
| `vokra/kimi-audio` | Complete native binder/composite route. |
| `vokra/kyutai-tts-1.6b-en-fr` | Complete native binder/composite route. |
| `vokra/qwen2-5-omni-7b` | Complete native binder/composite route. |
| `vokra/qwen2-audio-7b-instruct` | Resolve exact source-license boundary, then complete native route. |
| `vokra/step-audio2-mini` | Complete multi-component native route and source/weight/dependency review. |
| `vokra/vibevoice-asr` | Authenticate dataset, tokenizer and timestamp/diarization semantics before native route. |
| `vokra/vieneu-tts-v3-turbo` | Resolve voice-cloning/dependency policy and complete native route. |
| `vokra/xtts-v2` | Authenticate safe checkpoint and CPML/consent boundary before native composite. |
| `vokra/xy-tokenizer` | Obtain a real checkpoint payload; current GGUF has no tensors. |

### Twenty-one partial rows with incomplete released-artifact CPU forward

The live audit's reason for each is an incomplete CPU forward despite an
existing route or binder. Review each implementation against its own exact
source and license contract, finish the native forward/composite, then run
independent reference and real-weight CPU parity:

`vokra/audioldm2`, `vokra/audioldm2-large`, `vokra/canary-qwen-2.5b`,
`vokra/chatterbox-multilingual-v3`, `vokra/chatterbox-nano-v1`,
`vokra/chatterbox-turbo-v1`, `vokra/chattts`, `vokra/clap-htsat-fused`,
`vokra/cosyvoice2-0.5b`, `vokra/csm-1b`, `vokra/dia-1.6b`,
`vokra/firered-asr-aed-l`, `vokra/fun-cosyvoice3-0.5b-2512`,
`vokra/irodori-tts-500m-v3`, `vokra/kyutai-stt-2.6b-en`,
`vokra/owsm-v4-medium-1b`, `vokra/sortformer-diar-4spk-v1`,
`vokra/ultravox-v0-5-llama-3-2-1b`, `vokra/vibevoice-1.5b`,
`vokra/vibevoice-realtime-0.5b`, and `vokra/voxcpm-0.5b`.

### Twenty-two partial rows with a named artifact or companion boundary

| Public repository | Immediate boundary |
|---|---|
| `vokra/audiogen-medium` | Authenticate and bind the T5 conditioner and EnCodec decoder companions. |
| `vokra/canary-1b-flash` | Convert the complete AED decoder, aggregate tokenizer and authenticated manifest. |
| `vokra/canary-1b-v2` | Replace the misidentified auxiliary CTC GGUF with the complete AED conversion. |
| `vokra/conv-tasnet-libri1mix` | Resolve source-license/topology conflict and replace the stale artifact. |
| `vokra/lang-id-voxlingua107` | Publish a verified classifier plus ordered-label artifact after the gated replacement. |
| `vokra/mms-1b-all-base` | Supply the verified backbone rather than treating an adapter as the whole model. |
| `vokra/moss-audio-4b-instruct` | Correct provenance and tokenizer/chat/processor sidecars; run real-weight parity. |
| `vokra/moss-audio-8b-instruct` | Same independent correction and parity for the 8B identity. |
| `vokra/moss-audio-tokenizer-nano` | Replace the GGUF mis-stamped as Full with correct Nano provenance. |
| `vokra/moss-tts-local-transformer-v1.5` | Bind and verify its 48 kHz stereo MOSS Audio Tokenizer v2 companion. |
| `vokra/nsnet2` | Correct the public weight license/provenance and attribution. |
| `vokra/qwen3-asr-0.6b` | Replace old GGUF with exact audio metadata and five authenticated sidecars. |
| `vokra/qwen3-asr-1.7b` | Same gated replacement for the 1.7B identity. |
| `vokra/qwen3-tts-12hz-0.6b-base` | Apple parity, then variant/BPE-correct main and public tokenizer companion. |
| `vokra/qwen3-tts-12hz-0.6b-customvoice` | Apple parity, then correct identity/BPE sidecars and companion. |
| `vokra/qwen3-tts-12hz-1.7b-base` | Apple parity, then correct 1.7B topology/BPE sidecars and companion. |
| `vokra/qwen3-tts-12hz-1.7b-customvoice` | Apple parity, then correct 1.7B identity/BPE sidecars and companion. |
| `vokra/rmvpe` | Resolve exact-source license and replace the falsely permissive GGUF. |
| `vokra/sbv2-v2-jp-extra-base` | Correct public tensor names/metadata and production Japanese G2P. |
| `vokra/speechbrain-spkrec-ecapa-voxceleb` | Replace GGUF with out-of-bounds tensor data. |
| `vokra/wespeaker` | Correct CC-BY-4.0 weight provenance and attribution. |
| `vokra/yue-xcodec-mini` | Independently bind acoustic/semantic/fusion/RVQ PCM encode; decode alone is partial. |

### One non-artifact public repository

`vokra/seamless-m4t-v2-large` has no GGUF. Prepare a real gated artifact with
independent evidence or obtain an exact owner-approved withdrawal decision.
Neither outcome may be inferred from an empty repository.

## Other Apple and artifact debt outside the 58-row count

- GigaAM v3 passed a new no-upload VAST real-weight CPU replay at the Torch
  2.13.0 update in PR #131. Its older Apple verdict belongs to an older
  dependency/head; regenerate the packet and measure the current Apple CPU,
  Metal and no-fallback legs.
- Qwen3-TTS four variants passed independent VAST CPU parity in PR #109;
  their Apple measurements and gated public replacements remain pending.
- Distil-Whisper and Kotoba-Whisper passed real-weight VAST CPU parity; the
  final Apple measurements and repository disposition remain pending.
- Charsiu and other prepared rows still require their own Apple/evidence
  reconciliation; do not equate a full code route with device parity.
- `vokra/voxtral-small-24b-2507` has a stale false Mini-3B provenance stamp
  in its live GGUF. The historical retained VAST instance cited in the M5
  checklist is gone. Recreate any required 48-GB artifact on a new disposable
  VAST worker, then use the gated publisher only after exact artifact approval.

## Security queue

1. For each Python reference environment, select the alerts with published
   fixes, update its `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`, run model-free import/API
   and license gates, and repeat its independent real-weight reference/parity
   on VAST. Close alerts through a reviewed PR and GitHub dependency-graph
   rescan, not dismissal. Start with the existing isolated Ultravox and
   X-Codec2 Transformers branches; X-Codec2's Torch hard pin remains a
   separate blocker. Process the other environments independently rather
   than bulk-upgrading oracles.
2. For the 32 alerts without a published fix, recheck upstream releases and
   direct usage; remove or replace the dependency only with an independently
   verified reference contract. Keep unresolved alerts visible with an exact
   advisory and environment disposition.
3. Resolve Scorecard's five findings on their actual terms: external Best
   Practices registration; repository-age recheck; independent code review;
   CodeQL coverage of the rolling changeset window; and dependency
   remediation. Re-run Scorecard and inspect SARIF after the relevant changes.

The current detailed security execution record is
[`security-remediation-2026-09-21.md`](security-remediation-2026-09-21.md).
Its 261-alert snapshot predates PR #131 and the current 258-alert API result;
retain that dated observation and add a supersession note when refreshing it.

## Execution order and ownership

1. Keep the live 58-row TSV and GitHub alert snapshot as the starting audit;
   refresh them after each model/security merge. Preserve exact revision and
   evidence hashes. Use one model family or one Python environment per PR.
2. Close owner-independent source, dependency, runtime and reference work.
   The Sol manager reviews; Luna implementers own bounded implementation
   artifacts and focused checks. No oracle is accepted from a Vokra mirror.
3. Present only the exact unresolved source/license/operator decisions for
   owner review. A general instruction to finish the campaign does not
   supply a missing upstream license or change a non-commercial policy.
4. Run approved real-weight conversion/reference/CPU parity and workspace
   gates on disposable VAST workers. Recover hashes and small evidence;
   destroy instances and storage.
5. Freeze a clean head and regenerate direct transfer packets. Run the final
   Scaleway Apple CPU/reference, Metal/reference and Metal/CPU no-fallback
   batch. A failed device result returns to the implementation/VAST stage.
6. Apply separately authorized, repository-scoped upload or withdrawal
   decisions through `publish-one.sh` and its license/provenance gates;
   reconcile the live HF inventory, security alerts, Scorecard, docs and M5
   owner checklist. Never claim full catalog completion from code reachability
   alone.

## Final audit

Completion requires a current per-row disposition for all 194 public
repositories, with every executable row's source, license, native route,
independent CPU reference, VAST CPU result, Apple CPU/Metal/no-fallback result
and public artifact evidence linked to exact hashes. Every remaining security
alert must either be fixed or have a current evidence-backed upstream/policy
disposition, and all five Scorecard findings must be re-evaluated. Required
CI, workspace checks, documentation gates and branch protection must be
reviewed; no unrelated VAST/Scaleway resource may be modified. The worktree
and cloud resources must be reconciled before any completion claim.
